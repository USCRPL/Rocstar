/*
 * Some notes on multibyte character support:
 * 1. Patterns with illegal byte sequences match nothing.
 * 2. Illegal byte sequences in the "string" argument are handled by treating
 *    them as single-byte characters with a value of the first byte of the
 *    sequence cast to wchar_t.
 * 3. Multibyte conversion state objects (mbstate_t) are passed around and
 *    used for most, but not all, conversions. Further work will be required
 *    to support state-dependent encodings.
